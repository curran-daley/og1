-- close browser required. every window fails to close browser entirely.
-- must open 16x tabs per hour to view 4 page ads.
-- open tab = tab that is clicked to open, not default open when browser = activate.
-- consistent, sustained use result in pop-up ads. figure out a way to trigger this via autotyping, autoscrolling, url inputs, etc.
-- ensure browser is closed for X minutes, and open for X minutes + ensure activity occurs in order to trigure pop-up ads. 
-- can this run undetected, behind the scenes, 24hr a day, regardless of who is logged in, and have it immediately start upon log in? 
-- can this script also turn on the computer when it is shut down?
-- can you run a script immediately when a computer is turned on, irregardless of login or not, and irregardless of who is logged in or not?
-- run a script to enter login username and password remotely via autotyping?
-- run a script when mac powers on + on sign-in
-- run three scripts simultaneously in three different script browsers

-- AT BHS:
-- number the computers and keep track of passwords
-- test display to see if script runs when turned off
-- make sure all displays are turned on and computers never go to sleep
-- determine Dell operating system
-- access moms usernames/passwords
-- get keys from mom
-- created shared note between Grayden with passwords and Gemini information
